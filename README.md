# rust-injector
A Windows-based linked library injector, coded in Rust


attempting to create a linked library injector with Rust. currently not under development due to the following factors

1) fuck winapi

2) seriously microsoft what were you thinking?

3) moving to projects that are either platform agnostic or to Unix-like systems (BSD, OS X, Linux).

4) no motivation for development of this

feel free to fork and continue development though. this should be enough of a base to start off with.
